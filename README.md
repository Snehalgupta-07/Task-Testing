# Task-Testing

FOSS Wing Selection Tasks 🚀

Welcome to the selection tasks for the FOSS Wing of our tech society, Gravity.
These tasks are designed to test your debugging skills, Git knowledge, and creativity. Please read carefully and follow the instructions.

📌 General Instructions

All tasks must be done in your own branch (name it as yourname-task or something identifiable).

Make commits regularly with meaningful commit messages.

Where required, add answers/outputs in the PR message or in a new file.

Submit everything via a Pull Request (PR).

🔧 Tasks
1. Debug the Code 🐞

We will provide you with a small buggy code snippet.

Fix the code so it runs correctly.

Add the correct output in your PR message.

Commit the fixed code.

2. Git Merge Conflict ⚔️

We will provide a branch containing a file story.txt with some blanks.

Your task:

Fill in the blanks with a sensible continuation of the story.

Merge it into your branch.

Resolve any merge conflicts properly.

3. Find First Commit Hash 🔑

Use git log to find the hash of the very first commit in this repository.

Write the commit hash in a new file named first_commit.txt.

Commit this file.

4. Commit Removal 🧹

Make a commit adding something (say, create a file).

Make 3 more commits on top of it.

Now:

Remove the first commit while keeping the later changes intact.

Bonus: Remove all traces of the initial commit entirely (history rewrite).

Commit the cleaned-up history.

✨ Additional Task

Create a README.md in your branch (separate from this repo’s main README) with:

A short introduction about yourself.

Your hobbies.

Tech stacks you’ve explored till now.

Your strengths.

Bonus points: Add an appropriate meme at the end.

✅ Submission

Push your branch.

Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository.

Make sure your PR contains:

Debugged code output (in message).

Completed tasks committed in your branch.

Your personal README file.

⚡ That’s it! Good luck, and happy hacking! 🎉
